Learning Git is something that people should learn before starting develop web, app.
I'm diff than others, cuz I'm working alone. So most of my projects doesn't needs to
version-control. What im thinking is git will help me keep tracks what changes made to source code.
Am I suppose to blank empty space when delete something. what about comments? like adding few lines of
comment line number won't stay the same right? question is how git control keep track all of those changes
